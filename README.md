# 🎉 Movie Objects Project 🎉

## 📽️ Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of `Movie` objects using PHP Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal is to understand how to define classes, instance variables, methods, and how to instantiate objects.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Class Definition:** A class named `Movie` is defined with instance variables for title, director, release year, genre, duration, and rating.
- **Constructor:** The `Movie` class includes a constructor that initializes the instance variables.
- **Method:** A method is implemented to retrieve information about the movie.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Define a `Movie` class with:
   - Instance variables.
   - A constructor.
   - At least one method.
2. Instantiate at least two `Movie` objects and display their properties.

### Bonus Features

- **Bonus 1:** Modify the `Movie` class to accept multiple genres.
- **Bonus 2:** Create a complete layout to display a list of movies.
